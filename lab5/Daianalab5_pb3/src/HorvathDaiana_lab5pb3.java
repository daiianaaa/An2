//Develop a class hierarchy of shapes and write a program that computes the amount of paint needed
// to paint different objects. The hierarchy will consist of a parent class Shape with three derived
// classes - Sphere, Rectangle, and Cylinder. For the purposes of this exercise, the only attribute a
// shape will have is a name and the method of interest will be one that computes the area of the shape
// (surface area in the case of three-dimensional shapes). Do the following.
//A. Write an abstract class Shape with the following members:
// - an instance variable shapeName of String type
//- an abstract method area()
//- a toString() method that returns the name of the shape
//B. The file Sphere.java contains the Sphere class which is a descendant of Shape.
// A sphere has a radius as a private integer variable and implements the body of the inherited abstract
// method area().
//C. Define similar classes for a rectangle and a cylinder. The classes Rectangle and Cylinder are also
// derived from the Shape class. A rectangle is defined by its length and width. A cylinder is defined by a
// radius and height.
//Note: Each of the derived classes override the toString method and define specific mutator and accessor methods.
//D. The file Paint.java contains an interface that has a float constant paintPerSurfaceUnit.
//E. The file PaintThings.java implements the Paint interface and contains a program that computes the
// amount of paint needed to paint various shapes.
//Instantiate the three shape objects: deck <- Rectangle, bigBall <- Sphere and tank <- Cylinder.
// Make the appropriate method calls to assign each objectâ€™s specific attributes with data read from the keyboard.
//Compute the amount of paint needed for covering each created shape.
